# LeetCode playground

This is a repository containing my solutions to some Leetcode problems taken from [this list](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/).

## Repo structure

The repository structure is as follows:
```
+ {number}-{problem_title_kebab_case}
├───+ {lang}
│   └─── <solution files>
│
+ {number}-{problem_title_kebab_case}
├───+ {lang}
│   └─── <solution files>
│
+ {number}-{problem_title_kebab_case}
├───+ {lang}
│   └─── <solution files>
│
```

### Exercise solution structure

It heavily depends on the language I use, but ideally they have to be independently executable as soon as you cd into a `{exercise}/{lang}` folder.

Also, ideally, each script will have a tiny readme at least on requirements and how to run the exercises.

## Used languages

At the moment, this repo contains `rust` only. But when I feel like it I will use these exercises to build some confidence with other languages.

Used languages:
- `Rust`
